                      <p>My work experience should very well highlight that I work well with others. I am not one to argue with people on silly things, but I'm open to having debates and genuine conversations with others. My head isn't so closed minded or forceful where it must be one way to see things and with that I've worked well with many people. Sparks of discussion of any topic, where what you say will be genuinely heard and discussed when it comes to design plans or whatever has the situation lively at the moment.</p>
                      <p>I have experience in retail for four years at a dollar store where I played many parts in organizing a store and having to work with others. Covering shifts at odd hours of the day and trying my best to make things lighter for others. I know the job isn't much to show off but my commitment to my work was there. I did what was asked of me, and at times I did more than what was needed without receiving special compensation. I would of liked special compensation but that's not here nor there.</p>
                      <p>I had left that job for the last two years coming on three now and been, working hard in school being a game developer. Dealing with others who know more than I do and less than I do. There have been times where I have been a teacher to others and others where I am the student. I am not one to lie when it comes to work. Honesty sets a clear path for scope and the final destination for how games can come together, and I have seen it many times. I look forward to seeing my honesty and skill grow as I go through this chapter in my life pursuing to help others escape reality using video games as the method to get them there.</p>

                      <p>Now about me and my life. I am 24 years old, and it's been a fun ride thus far. I play lots of video games and watch a lot of game news. I am all about the next up and incoming new video games rather than games far before my time. I am a person that likes to look towards a better tomorrow more so than being stuck in the past trying to rekindle a flame far past its wick.</p>
                      <p>I had stopped watching TV about the age of 15. Since then, I haven't turned on a TV for myself in a long time. I just read manga or look at YouTube for entertainment apart from video games. It's something to ease the time and roughness of life when the day gets too hard. I enjoy just being able to read lots of manga as it gives me that fulfillment and joy that normal life day to day activities can't provide.</p>
                      <p>I raise turtles on the side as well. I have quite a few of them that I grew up with since I was little and they have been with me ever since.</p>

                      <p>I am currently getting through college and working on multiple game projects at the time of this post. I found a liking to making UI/UX in games and I seem to fit right into it. I want to try to explore this area of game design in order to become a better game developer for others and for myself. I have been apart of lots of team game building projects where I had my hands mostly in unity, and only a little bit inside of Unreal Engine. I find myself enjoying Unity more so but one of the games me and my team had created are on Unreal Engine and you can see it in the portfolio under Llamas With Tanks. I don't know how to code much; I am currently learning code along side AI to help me reach the goals of peers to help make the best games to go down in the history of gaming. So, that's where I'm at for the most part.</p>
